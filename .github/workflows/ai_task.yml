            You are working in a Next.js app under /web.
            Rules:
            - Only modify files under /web (do not change CI/workflows).
            - Do not add or print secrets.
            - Keep changes minimal and consistent with existing code style.
            - After changes, ensure: npm run lint && npm run build succeed.
